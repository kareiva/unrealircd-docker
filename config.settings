# These are the settings saved from running './Config'.
# Note that it is not recommended to edit config.settings by hand!
# Chances are you misunderstand what a variable does or what the
# supported values are. You better just re-run the ./Config script
# and answer appropriately there, to get a correct config.settings
# file.
